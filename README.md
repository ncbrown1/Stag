A simple web application that monitors the markup changes of static web pages over time. The backend will be written in Flask, providing a simple REST api and serving the static front end resources. The front end will be written in Ember.js and will consume the api provided by the Flask backend. This architecture is known as "Flyer" (<b><i>Fl</i></b>ask P<b><i>y</i></b>thon Emb<b><i>er</i></b>).
